Import this profile using your preferred mod instance manager but make sure to keep an uncompressed folder somewhere as your own repo. Whenever you've modified something and need it to be pushed then take your modified files and bring them back to the repo. If you've made any changes to the modlist then either message me on discord with the new mods if you must or export your profile and upload the new mod manifest.
